# In The Loop
 
## Description

I do occassionally like to read/watch the news, but I find a big problem that a lot of people face regarding the news, is that they over rely on one news source, which can create bias. 
I know I have definitely fallen for this trap before, so I have created a simple news web application which pulls news from a wide variety of sources! It utilizes
[NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org) to retrive all these articles.

## Features

### Easy to Use Interface

The interface is very simple, so it is easy for the user to quickly scroll through and view all the articles, the click the link of the article they want to read more about. The design is made to be very interactive using Tailwind + DaisyUI!

### Fitlers and Search Bar

The user is able to filter the news based on country, category, news source, or search for a specific keyword.
